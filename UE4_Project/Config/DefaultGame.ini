The Game, is an information and entertainment service and ancillary to this DMTA Studios are involved in the transmission, storage, retrieval, hosting, formatting or translation of third party communications without selection or alteration of the content of the communication, for which the Game is a mere conduit. By installing or using the Game you agree DMTA Studios has no responsibility to review the content of any UGC and that all UGC is made available on the basis that we are not required to and do not exercise any control or judgement in respect of their content. For the avoidance of doubt, the views expressed in any UGC are the views of the individual authors and not those of us unless expressly specified otherwise by us.11.3. We shall be entitled to remove, restrict, suspend or alter any user account and any UGC (and the ability to share or create UGC) for any reason in our discretion, including without limitation, because conduct or content associated with such account or UGC might be unacceptable as described in this EULA.UGC Rules11.4. You agree and undertake that you are entitled to make available, or post to or transmit to the Game UGC and to grant us those rights set out in clause 11.2, and will not make available, or post to or transmit to the Game any statement, material or other UGC, nor use the Game in any way, that:11.4.1. is abusive, seditious, pornographic, aggressive, homophobic, defamatory, libellous, untrue, hateful, discriminatory, obscene, inflammatory or racist;11.4.2. harasses, bullies or intimidates any person or obscures or impedes other users’ ability to communicate or read conversations (this includes the use of any macros/SPAM to either the general playerbase or a single individual to disrupt chat);11.4.3. involves exploitative behaviour, through but not limited to, third party programs, bots, scripts or other means which are reasonably prohibited by us from time to time, or which take advantage of bugs, unintended errors, or features that have not been documented, to access restricted parts of the Game or gain an unfair edge over other players;11.4.4. involves selling or trading your Game account or characters, or dealing or trading in currency (whether or not this occurs inside or outside of the game for in-game items) or which otherwise constitutes activity which we reasonably deem against the “spirit” of the Game;11.4.5. encourages any violation of this EULA or of a TPSP’s terms of service;11.4.6. is unlawful, malicious, misleading (including impersonation), discriminatory or which gives rise to civil or criminal liability or which might call us or the Game into disrepute;11.4.7. infringes upon the intellectual property or other rights of any third party or facilitates or encourages such infringement or entails the distribution of any player’s personal information (other than your own, as a private message);11.4.8. is technically harmful such as the introduction of computer viruses, worms, logic bombs or other malicious software or harmful data, or otherwise attempts to or actually does modify or interfere with the Game or overburden or disrupt any computer or server used by the Game;11.4.9. may be deemed a marketing or commercial communication;11.4.10. promotes any illegal or unlawful activity including but not limited to solicitation, gambling or the sale of prescription medicines;11.4.11. is aimed at persons under the age of 18 or which seeks or attempts to make any arrangement to meet a person under the age of 18;11.4.12. contains any restricted material, including but not limited to passwords, medical information or confidential information of any person;11.4.13. constitutes, in our reasonable opinion, cheating or misuse of the Game, or an attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Game or parts thereof, or to the accounts of other users or networks or devices; or11.4.14. solicits, invites, encourages, advocates, incites or provokes any or all of the foregoing.Notwithstanding the above, some of our games are an open-world sandbox, foregoing standard tropes and features of other online games. As a result the experience is, by design, user-lead and free-form in terms of what direction the Game might take. As such we, in our discretion, deem the majority of in-game conduct appropriate. There may be the potential for player versus player interaction in the Game (“PvP”).  We may provide in-game solutions for protecting in-game assets, but users should be vigilant and protect themselves from other players who are potential threats to their character. Attacking another player, even repeatedly, is not in itself considered harassment. Certain prolonged cases of harassment (for example only, spawn camping revival chambers) may, in our reasonable opinion, be outside the scope of good sportsmanship and we reserve the right to take such action as we deem appropriate in response to that behaviour.11.5. If you discover UGC which you believe contravene the EULA please notify us via the email address dowilliams@gmail.com.11.6.

Purchases of Virtual Items are subject to the terms of any TPSP through which your purchase is made.  To the extent that this clause 11 conflicts with such agreement between you and the relevant TPSP in respect of your purchase of Virtual Items, the terms of your agreement with the TPSP shall prevail.12.3. You are entitled to cancel purchases of Virtual Items you make through the Game within 14 days, and to receive a full refund.
